# Omniauth Strategy for iHealth

This strategy connects with iHealth using Ommniauth and OAuth 2.0.
You can apply for API access on iHealth's developer website [here](http://developer.ihealthlabs.com).


## Installing

Add the gem to your `Gemfile`...

```ruby
gem 'omniauth-ihealth', git: 'https://github.com/dukedigitalhealth/omniauth-ihealth'
```

... and then run `bundle install`.


## Usage

`OmniAuth::Strategies::IHealth` is Rack middleware. Read the OmniAuth docs for detailed instructions: https://github.com/intridea/omniauth

Here's a quick example, adding the middleware to a Rails app in `config/initializers/omniauth.rb`:

```ruby
Rails.application.config.middleware.use OmniAuth::Builder do
  provider :ihealth, ENV['KEY'], ENV['SECRET']
end
```


## Configuring

You can configure several options, which you pass in to the `provider` method via a `Hash`:

* `scope`: A list of permissions you want to request from the user, separated by spaces.
The available options are `OpenApiUserInfo`, `OpenApiActivity`, `OpenApiBG`, `OpenApiBP`, `OpenApiSleep`, `OpenApiSpO2`, and `OpenApiWeight`. You must include `OpenApiUserInfo`. Defaults to `OpenApiUserInfo`.

* `sc`: The Serial Code for the client. You can find this on the developer detail page on iHealth's website [here](http://developer.ihealthlabs.com/developerdetailpage.htm).

* `sv`: The SV value listed for OpenApiUserInfo on the [developer detail page](http://developer.ihealthlabs.com/developerdetailpage.htm).


## Auth Hash

Here's an example Auth Hash available in `request.env['omniauth.auth']`:

```ruby
{
	"provider" => "ihealth",
	"uid" => "12345",
	"info" => {
		"name" => "John Doe",
		"nickname" => "John Doe",
		"image" => "https://cloud.ihealthlabs.com/logos/12345.png"
	},
	"credentials" => {
		"token" => "ABCDEF...", # OAuth 2.0 access_token
		"refresh_token" => "ABCDEF...",
		"expires_at" => 1392501884,
		"expires" => true
	},
	"extra" => {
		"user_info" => {
			"name" => "John Doe",
			"gender" => "male",
			"birthday" => "2013-12-31",
			"image" => "https://cloud.ihealthlabs.com/logos/12345.png",
			"nickname" => "John Doe",
			"height" => 72.00, # height in inches
			"weight" => 180.00 # weight in pounds
		},
		"raw_info" => {
			"HeightUnit" => 0, # 0 for cm, 1 for ft
			"WeightUnit" => 0, # 0 for kg, 1 for lbs, 2 for stone
			"dateofbirth" => 1388534400,
			"gender" => "Male",
			"height" => 182.88,
			"logo" => "https%3a%2f%2fcloud.ihealthlabs.com%2flogos%2f12345.png",
			"nickname" => "John Doe",
			"userid" => "12345",
			"weight" => 81.6
		}
	}
}
```
